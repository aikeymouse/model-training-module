YOLO Training Pipeline Scripts

This package contains example scripts for the configurable training pipeline:
- validate_data.py: Dataset validation and cleaning
- generate_dataset.py: Synthetic dataset generation  
- train.py: Model training with progress tracking

These scripts demonstrate realistic output for a YOLO training workflow
and can be used as templates for implementing actual training pipelines.
